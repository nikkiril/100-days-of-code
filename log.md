# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 9th 2019

# Uploaded a very simple recipt program that I was practicing on. In class we outlined the very basic idea of a recipt program using a flow chart. I decided to push it a little further and have the program track and store the user input in a dictionary. I also continued the transaction until the user inputs 'end' (our flow chart only accounted for a set amount of transactions). Then I decided to code the program for practice. All in all it is a very simple start but one I'm glad I've made. In the future I'd like to revisit this simple idea while learning about databases and how to implement a gui.
