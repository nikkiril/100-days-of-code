# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Hello there! Made the decision to commit to the 100 days of code! I'm a computer science student who has been working to learn Python. My plan for this next 100 days is to start working through some coding challenges. I'm starting this at a fairly beginner level of knowledge. My hope is that by the end I'll have a decent grasp of the python language and be ready to tackle some personal projects I'd like to code.
